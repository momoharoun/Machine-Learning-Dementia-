# Dementia classification using machine learning models :)
This project was to find the best machine learning model for the classification to use on my dataset using the three features "demented, converted, non-demented," researchers can employ various algorithms such as logistic regression, support vector machines, and random forests. By training and evaluating these models on the dataset, they can compare their performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to determine the model that best fits the data and provides the most accurate predictions for dementia classification. The ultimate goal is to identify the model that achieves the highest overall performance and generalizes well to new, unseen data.
